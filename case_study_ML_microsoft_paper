Many teams across Microsoft have augmented their applications with machine learning and inference, some in some surprising domains. We asked survey respondents for the ways that they used AI on their teams. We card sorted this data twice, once to capture the application domain in which AI was being applied, and a second time to look at the (mainly) ML algorithms used to build that application. We found AI is used in traditional areas such as search, advertising, machine translation, predicting customer purchases, voice recognition, and image recognition, but also saw it being used in novel areas, such as identifying customer leads, providing design advice for presentations and word processing documents, providing unique drawing features, healthcare, and improving gameplay. In addition, machine learning is being used heavily in infrastructure projects to manage incident reporting, identify the most likely causes for bugs, monitor fraudulent Ô¨Åscal activity, and to monitor network streams for security breaches.
